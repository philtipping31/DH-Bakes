# Documented Manual Testing for | DH Bakes (E-commerce Application)

This project was tested throughout the duration of the project creation. This was done with ensuring the user story / feature was designed and working as intended when being coded.
The project was also tested frequently via Google Chrome Dev Tools for display issues and terminal issues.

User Story Testing is documented below along with other manual process testing to ensure the overall operation of the website works correctly.


## Validation Testing

### HTML Files

All Html pages were tested using [W3C Schools validator](https://validator.w3.org/) in logged in and logged out state.

All pages were viewed via the deployed site, navigating from the home page through to all other pages, right clicking and selecting 'View Page Source' copying this code directly into the HTML Checker.

The only outstanding issues I encountered were related to the 'custom_clearable_file_input.html' which is show below:

I tried to resolve as many as I could, but the duplicate ID was not able to be fixed:

I added an ALT to the image, but the error would not remove itself:

![HTML Validator alt issue](readmedocs/screenshots/alt-error-edit-product-html.png)
![HTML Validator alt issue two](readmedocs/screenshots/alt-error-edit-product-html-2.png)


All other issues were resolved and the HTML files now pass checks.

### CSS Files

All CCS Files were tested using [W3C Schools CCS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Tests came back with no errors first time.

### JavaScript Files

All additional JS files and script sections in HTML Files were tested using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

Any errors were fixed so all pass checks.

### Python Files

Python files were checked using the [CI PEP8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

Most errors were due to spacing and lines to long, all of these were resolved. Below shows each app and the file tested.

## Other Tests

The site has been tested on an iPhone13 Pro to check that the Chrome Dev tools responsiveness options are correct and to check that a site visitor can view the website and all pages with ease on a mobile device.

All links/buttons have been tested to ensure that the user can navigate around the site as the intend.

Check that toast messages show up to the user when they perform actions that require user notifications.

Security testing - ensure users without an account / ownership of content / admin access can't access pages using the URL necessary, implementing the 403 page for better UX

### Responsiveness 

As above, chrome dev tools responsive option was used throughout the development of this site, ensure a mobile first approach was taken. The site can be used as normal on mobiles/tablets as well as large laptop screens.

## Bugs/Issues

I have three contrast issues flagged up on WAVE when testing the project, however I am unable to see where these are so i've had to leave these issues.

All other bugs/issues found during manual testing were fixed and changed in the code to avoid the problem happening further
